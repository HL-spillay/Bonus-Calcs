name: Bonus Engine Scaffold
overview: Scaffold the Python bonus calculation engine with pre-filled config, module stubs, a data loader, and a regression test harness — all derived from the reverse-engineered logic in `docs/bonus-model-logic.md`.

## Key decisions

- **pandas** for all computation (replaces the copied ARRAYFORMULA rows — one vectorised operation per rule).
- **`config/policy.yaml`** pre-filled with every value extracted: KPI weights by country/store-type, monthly bonus amounts by position × country, overrider tiers, store-bonus weightings, oil thresholds, attendance gate (80%), per-person floor (50), cluster share (30%).
- **`config/cycle.yaml`** holds the month (`2026-05`), exchange rates (from `Exchange info`), and the two date cutoffs from `Qualifying Stores`.
- **`loader.py`** reads both `.xlsx` exports directly — no manual CSV conversion needed.
- **`tests/test_regression.py`** loads the `PAYOUT PER PERSON` tab from the Audit xlsx as ground-truth and asserts the engine matches within a tolerance, so we can prove correctness before trusting the new system.
- The analysis scripts (`_inspect.py`, `_read_audit.py`, etc.) stay as-is; they are not part of the engine.
- The `.venv` already has `openpyxl`. `pandas` and `pyyaml` will be added to `requirements.txt` and installed.
